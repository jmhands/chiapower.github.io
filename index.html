This is a similar methodology to the <a class="underline text-green-600" href="https://cbeci.org/">Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index</a>, where most likely mining hardware is known, and electricity cost is estimated, and the total power consumption of the bitcoin network is estimated using a low and high estimate of reference mining hardware. Estimating a mix of common reference hardware farmers using hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) by what is economical for Chia farming will depend on the capital expenditures of the hardware (CapEx) and operational expenditures for power, cooling, networking, and data center efficiency. Storage power efficiency is measured in TB/W which includes the overhead of the supporting hardware infrastructure to host the storage devices, but the largest upfront cost in Chia farming is the cost of the storage devices themselves. The Chia network also consumes energy during the plotting process, of which the cryptographic data is generated prior to being able to farm for the proof of space and time.</p><p class="text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600">Energy consumption in kWh can be calculated by assuming an estimated percentage of the network using consumer hardware with spare capacity (under utilized resources already owned), which happen to be very efficient due to the transition in mainstream computing devices to SSDs over the last decade, as well as the percent of dedicated farmers that are using dense storage configurations with data center grade equipment.

The Chia farming process is very lightweight, requiring very little disk io and further reduced in the <a class="underline text-green-600" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/">new consensus</a> through a mechanism called the plot filter. Although the amount of data transferred is very low, the frequency of data access depends on the size of the plots constructed and number of plots per drive (capacity per disk), measured with a K value, with the minimum K value = 32 consisting of ~108GB (~101GiB. Most farmers use  the minimum required K value for the network operation due to the ease of plotting, so the probability a single plot per disk passes the filter is very high, requiring the disk to be accessed frequently. While it is technically possible for a hard disk drive to spin down to zero idle power between slots, the resume latency from HDD power off or spindown is 10 seconds and HDDs consume higher power to spin up (in rush current) reaching up to 25W for a few seconds. The energy consumed for power up and the mechanical wear and tear on the device make it not practical to spin down the drives in regular use. Power savings on the other mechanical aspects of HDDs, for instance, management of the heads and actuators, are device specific, while link power states are subject to the host storage interface (both SAS and SATA have detailed power state machines that operate differently)</p><p class="text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600"><img class="max-w-full pt-6 pb-4" src="images/image13.png" alt="HDD Power" title="Power"/>

TCO is measured in TCO$/TBe/rack/month, where TCO is the sum of the total capital and operational expenditures ammorized of the effective or usable capacity of the storage system. The Chia power model utilizes a similar model assuming the most efficient way to store data is already widely being used.  Optimizing disk storage TCO involves getting the highest capacity HDDs, which offer the highest energy efficiency in terms of TB/W, as well as densely packed JBODs (just a bunch of disks) measured in TB/rack unit. Different architectures for warm storage (more frequently accessed) vs cold storage (archival, less frequently accessed) vary mostly around the amount of compute to storage ratio. Chia farming looks very similar to hyperscale HDD archival storage requiring minimum compute resources and networking resources for the actual harvester and farming protocols. Hyperscalers like <a class="underline text-green-600" href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/pan">Facebook</a> and Microsoft have written about their storage systems extensively because the <a class="underline text-green-600" href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/facebook-bryce-canyon-storage-system-specification">JBOD hardware designs</a> hardware designs are open source at the <a class="underline text-green-600" href="https://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute Project</a>.</p><p class="text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600"><img class="max-w-full pt-6 pb-4" src="images/image15.png" alt="JBOD" title="JBOD"/></p><p class="text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600">The model used to estimate power consumption for disks and supporting infrastructure is taken from the  <a class="underline text-green-600" href="https://www.snia.org/forums/sssi/programs/TCOcalc">SNIA open source storage TCO model</a> open source storage TCO model. Replication, erasure coding, and RAID for data protection is not assumed for use in the Chia farming model, due to the fact that plot data can be easily recreated upon disk failure. The model also assumes the majority of disk time is spent in active idle, where the motor is spinning and the disk can respond to commands in milliseconds. The total power consumption overhead for dense storage involves a storage server (or sometimes called headnode) that serves the operating system hosting the Chia harvester and/or farmer. The total power consumption must include the JBODs (which power consumption comes mostly from the disks, but some from the fans, SAS expanders, and backplane) and the servers and supporting infrastructure like networking routers and switches. Everything that is in the rack dedicated to Chia farming must be considered to accurately model the power consumption efficiency in TB/W. When comparing large farms, the majority of the TB/W is actually consumed by the disks themselves, not by the supporting infrastructure, so average capacity HDD is one of the top drivers of ave TB/W. We assume that most large farmers have came to the same conclusion as hyperscale data centers driving up TB/rack unit of space and driving down TB/W by using the highest capacity HDD, even at a minor increase in $/TB over a smaller capacity HDD.</p><h2 class="text-3xl tracking-wider break-words pt-6 pb-1 text-gray-700">Energy efficiency - Data center PUE</h2><p class="text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600">Hyperscalers like Facebook have achieved a world class PUE of 1.08 and have a large effort in sustainability and renewable energy. We assume most large farmers in the first few years are not optimizing for maximum power efficiency, but just like in Bitcoin over time the power efficiency will gravitate towards the most efficient solutions for power consumption, low cost electricity, and energy efficiency. The Pave equation assumes hyperscale like efficiencies for storage, since they are in fact storing most of the worlds data and the largest annual consumers of HDD and SSDs.</p><h3 class="text-2xl break-words pt-6 pb-1 text-gray-700">Power consumption in lower bound</h3><p class="text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600">Solid state drives are extremely power efficient.

Estimating a mix of common reference hardware farmers using hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) by what is economical for Chia farming will depend on the capital expenditures of the hardware (CapEx) and operational expenditures for power, cooling, networking, and data center efficiency. Storage power efficiency is measured in TB/W which includes the overhead of the supporting hardware infrastructure to host the storage devices, but the largest upfront cost in Chia farming is the cost of the storage devices themselves. The Chia network also consumes energy during the plotting process, of which the cryptographic data is generated prior to being able to farm for the proof of space and time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp

Although the amount of data transferred is very low, the frequency of data access depends on the size of the plots constructed and number of plots per drive (capacity per disk), measured with a K value, with the minimum K value = 32 consisting of ~108GB (~101GiB. Most farmers use  the minimum required K value for the network operation due to the ease of plotting, so the probability a single plot per disk passes the filter is very high, requiring the disk to be accessed frequently. While it is technically possible for a hard disk drive to spin down to zero idle power between slots, the resume latency from HDD power off or spindown is 10 seconds and HDDs consume higher power to spin up (in rush current) reaching up to 25W for a few seconds. The energy consumed for power up and the mechanical wear and tear on the device make it not practical to spin down the drives in regular use. Power savings on the other mechanical aspects of HDDs, for instance, management of the heads and actuators, are device specific, while link power states are subject to the host storage interface (both

break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600\"\u003eThe majority of nearline and high capacity HDDs are consumed by hyperscale data centers and large cloud service providers, where designing around lowest possible data center TCO is the ultimate goal. TCO is measured in TCO$/TBe/rack/month, where TCO is the sum of the total capital and operational expenditures ammorized of the effective or usable capacity of the storage system. The Chia power model utilizes a similar model assuming the most efficient way to store data is already widely being used.  Optimizing disk storage TCO involves getting the highest capacity HDDs, which offer the highest energy efficiency in terms of TB/W, as well as densely packed JBODs (just a bunch of disks) measured in TB/rack unit. Different architectures for warm storage (more frequently accessed) vs cold storage (archival, less frequently accessed) vary mostly around the amount of compute to storage ratio. Chia farming looks very similar to hyperscale HDD archival storage requiring minimum compute resources and networking resources for the actual harvester and farming protocols. Hyperscalers like \u003ca class=\"underline text-green-600\" href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast21/presentation/pan\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and Microsoft have written about their storage systems extensively because the \u003ca class=\"underline text-green-600\" href=\"https://www.opencompute.org/documents/facebook-bryce-canyon-storage-system-specification\"\u003eJBOD hardware designs\u003c/a\u003e hardware designs are open source at the \u003ca class=\"underline text-green-600\" href=\"https://www.opencompute.org/\"\u003eOpen Compute Project\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"max-w-full pt-6 pb-4\" src=\"images/image15.png\" alt=\"JBOD\" title=\"JBOD\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600\"\u003eThe model used to estimate power consumption for disks and supporting infrastructure is taken from the  \u003ca class=\"underline text-green-600\" href=\"https://www.snia.org/forums/sssi/programs/TCOcalc\"\u003eSNIA open source storage TCO model\u003c/a\u003e open source storage TCO model. Replication, erasure coding, and RAID for data protection is not assumed for use in the Chia farming model, due to the fact that plot data can be easily recreated upon disk failure. The model also assumes the majority of disk time is spent in active idle, where the motor is spinning and the disk can respond to commands in milliseconds. The total power consumption overhead for dense storage involves a storage server (or sometimes called headnode) that serves the operating system hosting the Chia harvester and/or farmer. The total power consumption must include the JBODs (which power consumption comes mostly from the disks, but some from the fans, SAS expanders, and backplane) and the servers and supporting infrastructure like networking routers and switches. Everything that is in the rack dedicated to Chia farming must be considered to accurately model the power consumption efficiency in TB/W. When comparing large farms, the majority of the TB/W is actually consumed by the disks themselves, not by the supporting infrastructure, so average capacity HDD is one of the top drivers of ave TB/W. We assume that most large farmers have came to the same conclusion as hyperscale data centers driving up TB/rack unit of space and driving down TB/W by using the highest capacity HDD, even at a minor increase in $/TB over a smaller capacity HDD.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 class=\"text-3xl tracking-wider break-words pt-6 pb-1 text-gray-700\"\u003eEnergy efficiency - Data center PUE\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp class=\"text-lg tracking-normal leading-relaxed break-words text-justify py-6 text-gray-600\"\u003eHyperscalers like Facebook have achieved a world class PUE of 1.08 and have a large effort in sustainability and renewable energy. We assume most large farmers in the first few years are not optimizing for maximum power efficiency, but just like in Bitcoin over time the power efficiency will gravitate towards the most efficient solutions for power consumption, low cost electricity, and energy efficiency.
