Quality is the goal of reducing time zero failures. Some lower-end drive models are not tested as robustly as high-end drive models in the factory prior to shipping, although they may have a higher chance of being DOA (dead on arrival). These are not to be confused with reliability issues, which are caused by extended use of the device. Enterprise HDDs are rated at 2M or 2.5M hours MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure), which equates to 0.44% and 0.35% AFR (Annual Failure Rate), respectively. MTBF and AFR are the same metrics expressed in different ways. Mean Time Between Failure is the total amount of drive hours before a failure is expected. This does not mean a single drive can last for 2 million hours; it means if you have a collection of drives running, you should expect one failure every 2M total drive power-on hours (the sum of all the drives).
