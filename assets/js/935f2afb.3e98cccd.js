Proofs of space must be generated in a process called plotting, which is defined in the Chia proof of space construction document and first introduced in Beyond Hellman.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Hardware Resources/farming":{"id":"Hardware Resources/farming","title":"Farming","description":"alt_text","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Hardware Resources/hw":{"id":"Hardware Resources/hw","title":"Hardware Resources Required","description":"A participant can join the network with as little as one plot, which the minimum size for Chia is k=32, or 101.3GiB/108.8GB. Farmers with a small amount of capacity, and therefore an extremely low chance to win a block reward, will most often choose to join a pool. In Chia the pooling protocol is all done on-chain and the farmers still create the blocks, which maintains decentralization. The only resources required to start are enough free space for a single plot and a computer to host the full node software. There is optional farming software from 3rd parties that the consumer only runs a light client, running either only the harvester or the harvester and the farmer and connecting to a remote full node. This eliminates the requirements to run a full node, but most farmers are still running a full node due to the low requirements and independence and decentralization benefit. This is also the default mode in the official Chia wallet and farming desktop application.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Hardware Resources/node":{"id":"Hardware Resources/node","title":"Full Node","description":"Full node. The full node in the Chia is the peer-to-peer protocol that contains actually syncing the blockchain. Chia uses Nakamoto consensus, which means the network is permissionless, decentralized, and follows a Poisson distribution for inter-blocktime arrival. The full node requirements are designed to be extremely low, since the proof of space verification is very lightweight. It is designed to run on low-power, low core-count commodity computing devices (e.g. cheap laptop, Raspberry pi4.) There is a small-capacity SSD requirement to house the database for the blockchain, which is not a problem since a 256GB is currently cheaper than the cheapest HDD [IDC, 2021]. Chia has profiled the blockchain database workload to not take up a considerable amount of storage space and fit on a mainstream SSD included in every laptop, desktop, or easily available in the global consumer SSD market which includes 360 million SSDs per year [IDC, 2021].","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Hardware Resources/plotting":{"id":"Hardware Resources/plotting","title":"Plotting","description":"The Chia plotting workload is only required to be performed once per plot during the initial creation, where the final plot file lives on a low power storage device for the remainder of the years of farming. The plotting process involves the creation of the cryptographic data that is stored on the farming devices, and requires compute and ephemeral storage resources to create. Plotting is a one time energy consumption use per the total Netspace, as the data to be stored for farming only needs to be created once. More details about the plotting process can be found in the Chia Proof of Space Construction document. The Chia community has reference hardware posted with the amount of data that various machines can plot per day, and the average power consumption of the systems can be measured or estimated very accurately (since these are common consumer or server platforms). Users also record the amount of data they are able to plot per day per machine making it practical to estimate the energy consumption to create the Chia plots, estimated in kWh/TiB plotted. A k=32 plot is expected to live for at least a 5 year period, and thus the energy required to create the plot is amortized over the life of the plot. The total power consumed to plot the entire Netspace can be estimated using the range of reference hardware, then divided by the number of years for the average energy consumption contribution in the network coming from plotting. Although plotting systems consume real power to operate, the contribution to the total annual energy consumption is 20-30x lower than the actual power consumed by the storage devices for farming. Current fast Chia plotters can produce 1TB of plots with as little as 0.4kWh of electricity.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Hardware Resources/timelord":{"id":"Hardware Resources/timelord","title":"Timelords","description":"Proof of Time, Verifiable Delay Function","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Intro","description":"Storage is a perfect medium for blockchain security being both cryptographically verifiable and scarce. Storage is a commodity with a large market and multiple major global players. It is power-efficient and scalable and can incentivize the circular economy.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Model/model":{"id":"Model/model","title":"Chiapower Energy Model","description":"The Chiapower model observes Netspace growth, industry analyst reports, and first-hand reporting directly from the HDD vendors on the capacity mix for HDDs attributed to Chia. The total power consumption on the Chia network can be estimated by taking the total Netspace (similar to hashing power in bitcoin) and modeling the power consumption of the storage devices (farming) and the energy consumed to create the data (plotting). This is a similar methodology to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, where most likely mining hardware is known, and electricity cost is estimated, and the total power consumption of the bitcoin network is estimated using a low and high estimate of reference mining hardware. Estimating a mix of common reference hardware farmers using hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) by what is economical for Chia farming will depend on the capital expenditures of the hardware (CapEx) and operational expenditures for power, cooling, networking, and data center efficiency. Storage power efficiency is measured in TB/W which includes the overhead of the supporting hardware infrastructure to host the storage devices, but the largest upfront cost in Chia farming is the cost of the storage devices themselves. The Chia network also consumes energy during the plotting process, wherein the cryptographic data is generated prior to being able to farm for the proof of space and time.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Power/powerhdd":{"id":"Power/powerhdd","title":"Power Requirements for Hard Drives","description":"The Chia farming process is very lightweight, requiring very little disk io by only having to perform a proof quality check on most lookups, and through a mechanism called the plot filter which reduces the io by a factor of the constant. In Chia the plot filter is currently set to 512, meaning that on every challenge a plot has a 1/512 chance of being eligible. Although the amount of data transferred is very low, the frequency of data access depends on the size of the plots constructed and number of plots per drive (capacity per disk), measured with a K value, with the minimum K value = 32 consisting of ~108GB (~101GiB. Most farmers use the minimum required K value for the network operation due to the ease of plotting and the disk is accessed frequently, but still only transfers a small amount of data. These parameters dictate power savings depending on the device type used for farming since SSD and HDD have very different power states and latency profiles.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Power/powerssd":{"id":"Power/powerssd","title":"SSDs and Chia farming","description":"Solid-state drives are extremely power efficient. Designed for use in laptops and mobile devices for long battery life, NAND and SSD controllers are architected for near-zero idle power consumption. The NVM Express (NVMe) specification for solid-state drives contains various features for power savings, with mainstream consumer SSDs ranging from 2-4mW idle power with 5-8mS resume latency.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Reliaiblity/reliability":{"id":"Reliaiblity/reliability","title":"Reliability of Storage Devices in Chia Farming","description":"Chia is an extremely light workload compared to typical end-user workloads, 0.37% of the lowest HDD rated workload limit of 200TB/year. It is also 309 times lower disk busy time than an example hyperscale data center workload. Plot files contain random cryptographic hashes that can easily be created with no user data, removing data durability requirements for data storage in Chia farming. Hard drives, SSDs, or any consumer electronic device, don\u2019t have a rated lifetime, reliability is measured in the annual failure rate or mean time between failure. They do have a warranty, most often 5 years which is used for most LCA (life cycle assessments). SSDs also have a rated endurance measured in host writes, TBW (terabytes written). HDDs have a rated workload in TB/year for both reads and writes, due to mechanical wear on the drive.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Reliaiblity/ssdendurance":{"id":"Reliaiblity/ssdendurance","title":"SSD Endurance","description":"The fastest plot creation is done completely in memory, but requires a server with a large amount of DRAM to perform this. Most consumer plotters are using an SSD as temporary storage to perform plotting. Mainstream SSDs today use NAND flash technology to store data. NAND is high performance, scalable, and low cost - warranting the use in virtually every computing segment from mobile phones, SD cards, consumer laptops, and data centers. However, NAND must be erased before the cell is programmed, a process known as a program erase cycle, and can only be performed a certain amount of times before the NAND cell wears out and can no longer reliably store user data. This is defined generally as an SSD no longer meeting the UBER (uncorrectable bit error rate), retention time (how long the device can store user data safely while powered off, at a given temperature), or functional failure (device can no longer power on). The metrics to measure endurance of an SSD is defined in Terabytes Written, or TBW, at a certain workload. The workload defined is generally the JESD219 workload from JEDEC organization. An SSD can still plot well beyond meeting it\'s rated TBW limit, because UBER can be measured (when seeing host errors) and retention is not required (Chia plotting requires temporary or ephemeral storage).","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Sustainability/Circularity":{"id":"Sustainability/Circularity","title":"Circularity","description":"Circularity","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Sustainability/sustainability":{"id":"Sustainability/sustainability","title":"LCAs","description":"The major vendors for hard disk drives, Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba, are publicly traded companies and release annual sustainability reports, and ESG data on their products.

This leaves a tremendous opportunity for storage-based cryptocurrencies to leverage this resource to secure the blockchain while offering the user a reward as an incentive. With Chia farming becoming easier and more accessible, the vision is that any user with extra capacity can easily participate in the Chia network, earn rewards, and quickly reclaim the space needed for user data.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
